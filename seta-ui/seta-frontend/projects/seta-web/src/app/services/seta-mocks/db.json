		"abstract": "Privacy is one of the most important properties an information system must satisfy. A relatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient to guarantee privacy when datamining techniques are used. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of modifying the database in such a way to prevent the discovery of sensible information. Due to the large amount of possible techniques that can be used to achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide some standard evaluation metrics to determine the best algorithms for a specific application or context. Currently, however, there is no common set of parameters that can be used for this purpose. Moreover, because sanitization modifies the data, an important issue, especially for critical data, is to preserve the quality of data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no approaches have been developed dealing with the issue of data quality in the context of PPDM algorithms. This report explores the problem of PPDM algorithm evaluation, starting from the key goal of preserving of data quality. To achieve such goal, we propose a formal definition of data quality specifically tailored for use in the context of PPDM algorithms, a set of evaluation parameters and an evaluation algorithm. Moreover, because of the 'environment related' nature of data quality, a structure to represent constraints and information relevance related to data is presented. The resulting evaluation core process is then presented as a part of a more general three step evaluation framework, taking also into account other aspects of the algorithm evaluation such as efficiency, scalability and level of privacy.",

				"abstract": "Privacy is one of the most important properties an information system must satisfy. A relatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient to guarantee privacy when datamining techniques are used. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of modifying the database in such a way to prevent the discovery of sensible information. Due to the large amount of possible techniques that can be used to achieve this goal, it is necessary to provide some standard evaluation metrics to determine the best algorithms for a specific application or context. Currently, however, there is no common set of parameters that can be used for this purpose. Moreover, because sanitization modifies the data, an important issue, especially for critical data, is to preserve the quality of data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no approaches have been developed dealing with the issue of data quality in the context of PPDM algorithms. This report explores the problem of PPDM algorithm evaluation, starting from the key goal of preserving of data quality. To achieve such goal, we propose a formal definition of data quality specifically tailored for use in the context of PPDM algorithms, a set of evaluation parameters and an evaluation algorithm. Moreover, because of the 'environment related' nature of data quality, a structure to represent constraints and information relevance related to data is presented. The resulting evaluation core process is then presented as a part of a more general three step evaluation framework, taking also into account other aspects of the algorithm evaluation such as efficiency, scalability and level of privacy.",

A relatively new trend shows that classical access control techniques are not sufficient to guarantee privacy when Data Mining techniques are used. Such a trend, especially in the context of public databases, or in the context of sensible information related to critical infrastructures, represents, nowadays a not negligible thread. Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) algorithms have been recently introduced with the aim of modifying the database in such a way to prevent the discovery of sensible information. This is a very complex task and there exist in the scientific literature some different approaches to the problem. In this work we present a 'Survey' of the current PPDM methodologies which seem promising for the future.",
