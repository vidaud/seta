text: Dried food is a major element in modern food processing and a staple ingredient
  for an increasing variety of foodstuffs. Dried food offers many advantages for the
  mass production of commercially prepared goods, not least cheaper transportation
  costs, longer storage life and ease of use. However modern drying methods, such
  as Accelerated Freeze-Drying, prove costly, time consuming, labour and energy intensive,
  limitations which can prove more crippling for SMEs. There is a need to provide
  EU dried food SMEs with a technology which will help to remain competitive in the
  EU and global dried food sectors. Preliminary research conducted to date suggests
  that the application of high power ultrasound (HPU) for the dehydration of porous
  materials may be very effective in processes in which heat-sensitive materials such
  as foodstuff have to be treated. HPU is a powerful technology that is safe and environmentally
  friendly, efficient and economical. High-intensity ultrasonic vibrations are capable
  of affecting mass transfer processes with the result of increasing the drying rate
  of materials, thereby permitting the use of lower temperatures or shorter treatment
  times.  This process thus shows promise for assisting the dehydration of fruits,
  vegetables and other foods, preserving the quality attributes of the food products
  and during this project a HPU based pre-treatment method will be developed. A prototype
  will be built and tested prior to conventional drying processes to improve the added
  value of the dried product and enable faster, more cost effective and energy efficient
  drying of food, which will empower and equip SMEs from the European dried food industry
  to compete against the growing threat of global competition and large multinationals.
  It will also result in increased sales of high powered ultrasound components and
  equipment. The project holds benefits for European competitiveness and innovation,
  employment, the environment and society at large.
