The expected increase of the global demand for metals needed for the energy transition might become a driver to initiate commercial deep sea mining, paved by the technological advancements. However, before any deep-sea mining activities start, the environmental impacts, and how to mitigate them, need to be well understood; a robust legal framework needs to be in place and a reliable and transparent monitoring and supervising system for the activities taking place in the deep-sea has to be ready. For the sake of transparency and to properly assess the environmental consequences of the activities taking place in the deep sea over time, it is crucial to develop and to put in place a system capable of continuous monitoring, of the exploration and exploration activities, so the permitting and supervising authorities can access it remotely and at any moment. </span></p><p><span>The actions should design and develop a reliable and robust monitoring and inspection system for the exploration and future exploitation activities in the deep-sea.

Due to the complexity of such system, the project has to be developed by a multidisciplinary team, looking at environmental, legal and technological solutions.

Two technological routes to achieve this goal will be explored:\n\u2022\tThe reduction of the energy consumption for inflight de-icing through the development of coatings that exploit the use of a new generation of low-energy consuming active de-icing systems.\n\u2022\tThe development of durable and effective active and passive surface protection systems that will facilitate and maintain laminar boundary layers on aerodynamic surfaces. These coatings will reduce insect adhesion through novel, low-surface-energy concepts and remove insect residue through photoactive/enzymatic activity on nanotextured coatings.\nThe high-speed airflow over aircraft can contain sand, water droplets, insects, ice crystals and other particles, and there thus exists a significant challenge to produce protective coatings for this varied and demanding environment. AEROMUCO will develop multifunctional coatings with both anti-contamination and anti-icing properties that will also protect the aircraft\u2019s skin from erosion. These novel coatings will be customized to the requirements of the location on the wing (e.g. leading edge contamination avoidance, upper surface runback ice prevention).\nThe multi-disciplinary approach will yield technological improvements beyond the state of the art through a structured, but innovative, research strategy. A comprehensive set of unique tests will be performed, including ice build-up tests (microscopic and full-scale icing wind tunnel tests), comparative rain erosion tests, abrasion tests, and an assessment of kinetic of enzyme processes.", "date": "2019-08-01", "author": ["Photon et Polymers", "INSTITUT DE RECHERCHES EN INGENIERIE DES SURFACES SAS", "SAAB AKTIEBOLAG", "CSEM CENTRE SUISSE D'ELECTRONIQUE ET DE MICROTECHNIQUE SA - RECHERCHE ET DEVELOPPEMENT", "University of Food Technologies", "INSTITIUID TEICNEOLAIOCHTA BHAILE ATHA CLIATH", "ALENIA AERMACCHI SPA", "AIRBUS DEFENCE AND SPACE GMBH", "UNIVERSITY OF LIMERICK", "UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA", "DASSAULT AVIATION", "C.I.R.A.

Dried food offers many advantages for the mass production of commercially prepared goods, not least cheaper transportation costs, longer storage life and ease of use. However modern drying methods, such as Accelerated Freeze-Drying, prove costly, time consuming, labour and energy intensive, limitations which can prove more crippling for SMEs. There is a need to provide EU dried food SMEs with a technology which will help to remain competitive in the EU and global dried food sectors. Preliminary research conducted to date suggests that the application of high power ultrasound (HPU) for the dehydration of porous materials may be very effective in processes in which heat-sensitive materials such as foodstuff have to be treated. HPU is a powerful technology that is safe and environmentally friendly, efficient and economical. High-intensity ultrasonic vibrations are capable of affecting mass transfer processes with the result of increasing the drying rate of materials, thereby permitting the use of lower temperatures or shorter treatment times.  This process thus shows promise for assisting the dehydration of fruits, vegetables and other foods, preserving the quality attributes of the food products and during this project a HPU based pre-treatment method will be developed. A prototype will be built and tested prior to conventional drying processes to improve the added value of the dried product and enable faster, more cost effective and energy efficient drying of food, which will empower and equip SMEs from the European dried food industry to compete against the growing threat of global competition and large multinationals. It will also result in increased sales of high powered ultrasound components and equipment.
