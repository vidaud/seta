						"question":"<b>1. What is SeTA?</b>",
						"answer":"SeTA – Semantic Text Analyser – applies advanced text analysis techniques to large document collections, helping policy analysts to understand the concepts expressed in thousands of documents and to see in a visual manner the relationships between these concepts and their development over time.<br></br><center><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jd6iXKr2UZg' title='YouTube video player' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share' allowFullScreen> </iframe></center><br></br>Hundreds of thousands of documents have been collected from different sources and analysed by the SeTA tool. These systems and repositories are under the responsibility of the Publications Office of the European Union (OP) which publishes and disseminates the publications of the institutions and other bodies of the European Union:<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>• EUR-Lex</b><br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>• EU Publications</b><br></br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>• CORDIS</b> <br></br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>• EU ODP</b><br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>• PUBSY</b><br></br>The auxiliary document repository also contains documents from: <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Full copy of Wikipedia dump (6M articles, 13GB). <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- 39 million open source scientific articles that were collected by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- A full copy (590.000 documents) of the US federal legislation since 1994."

						"question":"<b>2. How is the information extracted and later trained to be used in SeTA?</b>",
						"answer":"The result information comes from a knowledge base. It is created as a result of two steps:<br></br>&emsp;1) document collection, cleaning and storage and <br></br>&emsp;2) the actual text analysis and modelling.<br></br>The corpus of the public policy-related European documents counts more than 500.000 documents, coming from the following sourcesescribed: <b>EUR-LEX</b>, <b>EU Publications</b>, <b>CORDIS</b>, the <b>EU Open Data Portal</b>, and <b>JRC PUBSY</b>. <br></br>Documents are retrieved through <b>SPARQL, SOAP, OAI-PHM, FTP or HTTP</b> protocol parsing, even though every source has its own specificities.<br></br>The output is a document repository containing the completely cleaned unified plain text, divided into sentences.This new document structure is stored within an ElasticSearch (ES) database which allows searching and reproduction for human readers.The original text is also stored in the same database."
					},
					{
						"question":"<b>3. How is the database trained to create the relations between the results data?</b>",
						"answer":"We used a powerful python library for language modelling called 'gensim' for the neural network training.<br></br>Currently there are three topologies in use:<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;- <b>Skip-gram Word2Vec</b> for similarity queries<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;- Continuous Bag of Words <b>(CBOW)</b> with sub-word information (FastText, Bojanowski 2016) is used for calculations in the vector space<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;- <b>Doc2Vec DM </b>(distributed memory, Le and Mikolov, 2014) for document similarity calculations.<br></br>The training of one network using Word2Vec topology takes about 20 hours on a fast Linux workstation with 36 physical cores and plenty of RAM. Models persisted to hard disk take about 5GB.<br></br> The training of one network in FastText topology takes about 80 hours on the same system and the models are also of about 5GB in size.<br></br>The training of one network in Doc2Vec topology takes about 8 hours on the same workstation and the models are of about 25GB in size.<br></br>All the texts collected are in English only (except for some older legal texts where multiple languages are interleaved on the same page).<br></br>The reasons for this decision are: <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. English language sentence dependency parsing is rather straightforward and there are several open source semantic parsers with excellenttuning for this language. <br></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. We are interested in extracting knowledge from plain text and as the translation of, for example, a directive into all EU languages does not create new knowledge, processing a single language well should capture the available information."
