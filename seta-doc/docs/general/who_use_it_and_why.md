^^SeTA^^ is developed for anybody who wants to search in EU publications according to *meaning* as opposed to according to *literal* text. The user can search by presenting one or more keywords, but also by presenting text or even an entire document.       

SeTA provides a semantic system that brings entities, concepts, relations and predicates together to provide more context to language so it is possible to understand text data with more accuracy.

SeTA also provides the use of Communities, either as a creator or as a participant. In this way, users can connect with people with similar interests to share information.
