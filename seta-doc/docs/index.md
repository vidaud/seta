SeTA – Semantic Text Analyser – applies advanced text analysis techniques to large document collections, helping policy analysts to understand the concepts expressed in thousands of documents and to see in a visual manner the inter-relationships between these concepts and their development over time. Hundreds of thousands of documents have been collected from different sources and analysed by the SeTA tool. These repositories, under the responsibility of the Europan Commission, include:
