**SeTA** (*Semantic Text Analyser*) is a web application that provides a suite of functionalities:

## Data Sources

SeTA's *Data Sources* are shared repositories of information, enabling users to explore specific areas of interest.

## Search Tool
SeTA's Search tool allows users to navigate through the content of the data sources within the site. The Search tool can index a large set of document collections.

Capable of indexing a vast array of document collections, the Search tool provides a list of documents and specific locations therein where the inputted keyword(s) occur. 

The search functionality is enhanced beyond mere literal keyword finding, thanks to the use of a taxonomy that structures predefined keywords and semantic interpretation of the keywords. 
This allows the tool to understand the meaning of the words in addition to their literal form.

The search results can then be easily screened and filtered by the user.      

SeTA facilitates the exploration of information in a document collection by making sense of the textual content and identifying links.
To enable this analysis, the document collection to be searched or explored must be pre-processed using advanced text mining techniques. 

This has been done for four large document collections published by EU bodies:

- **EUR-Lex**, the official online database of all EU legal documents;      
- **CORDIS**, which contains the results of the projects funded by the EU's framework programs for research and innovation;       
- **PUBSY**, the publications repository of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre;      
- and all publications of the **European Parliament**.      

These four collections are readily available for immediate search. SeTA can also work on additional document collections created in the data sources, but they first have to be ingested and pre-processed by the user.        

## APIs
The APIs used by the search tool is also exposed for third-party clients and developers. You can check their documentation in `SeTA User Guide > Web APIs` section.
     
The APIs serve as a viable alternative for users who need to integrate the tools SeTA offers with their own applications or require more flexibility in information-transfer processes.
