SeTA – Semantic Text Analyser – applies advanced text analysis techniques to large document collections, helping policy analysts to understand the concepts expressed in thousands of documents and to see in a visual manner the relationships between these concepts and their development over time. Hundreds of thousands of documents have been collected from different sources and analysed by the SeTA tool.
