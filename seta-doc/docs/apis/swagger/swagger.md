The SeTA APIs use the support of Swagger.  Swagger is an open source collection of guidelines, requirements, and resources for creating and defining RESTful APIs. Making interactive, machine- and human-readable API documentation is made possible by the Swagger framework.          



## Benefits of Swagger
Swagger helps describing an API's structure so that computers may comprehend it. By reading the structure of the API, it can automatically generate beautiful and interactive API documentation. It also makes it possible to investigate different possibilities, including automated testing.     
Swagger achieves this by requesting a comprehensive YAML or JSON answer from the API that provides a detailed description of the whole API. The resources of the API are listed in this file, which adheres to the OpenAPI Specification. The specification requests include details like:

1. What are all the operations that the API supports?
2. What are the APIâ€™s parameters and what does it return?
3. Does the API need some authorization?

And even things like terms, contact information and license to use the API.

In Swagger it is possible to write spec for the API manually, or have it generated automatically from annotations in the source code.      
Check the [open-source-integrations](swagger.io/open-source-integrations) page for a list of tools that let you generate Swagger from code. 


Swagger can help drive the API development further:                     
- Design-first users: with the use of Swagger Codegen it is possible to generate a server stub for the API. The only thing left is to implement the server logic.             
With the use of Swagger UI, it is possible to generate interactive API documentation that lets users try out the API calls directly in the browser.
