### Filters         
There are some filters that can be applied to refine the search of the results:

`Text chunk`   
: Chunking is a process of extracting phrases from unstructured text, in our case, it is possible to filter the results by:                
  1. First chunk of the text                  
  2. Single chunk only                     
  3. Any chunks              

`Filter by date range`
: If this option is switched on, then the time range bar below, can be adjust to the custom year range.        

`Data sources`        
: In this section it is possible to select from the different sources available a more specific source topic.

`Taxonomies`                
: From the different taxonomies proposed in this section, it can be possible to select only the results with a specific group of interest.

`Other`
: In this section it is possible to filter the results with an extra parameter, this parameter can be any of the tags that appears in tag ^^Other^^ from the uploaded documents (e.g. *crc, project_piknus, regions, identifiers*).




Once all the filters are selected, click in the button **Apply Filters** at the top of the section to apply them.
