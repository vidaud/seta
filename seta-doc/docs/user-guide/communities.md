## General
The communities of the SeTA web app is a shared space where members engage with each other to connect and learn about similar interests opinions of different type of publications. 

In the SeTA Web App we have two types of communities: public communities and private communities.   

* **Public Community**:  Anyone with access to the web app can view all discussion forums and information in the online Community. Anyone can join the Community and contribute  to the Community.   

* **Private Community**:  The information and conversations can only be accessed by users with log-ins(often sent via invitation to a specific group or pre-loaded into the Community platforms membership database). All users are forced to ask for authorization to join and then been able to see content and conversations. In this type of communities the administrators have the ability to deny access to users who don't fit membership credentials (i.e. *members customers participants in a specific industry*)

If you can't claim the manager role in a Community it may be because there are managers or other people have recently been accepted to become a manager.==}


### Difference between a viewer and contributor in public communities
                        
In public communities you can interact with a Community as a viewer or as a contributor.   

-  **Contributor**:  someone who has joined the Community. 
    - No manager approval required. 
    - Can upload a document. 
    
- **Viewer**: someone who isn't a member of the Community. 
    - No manager approval required. 
    - Can upload a document. 
    
- **Participant**: a member or visitor who has posted or commented in the Community. 
    - Manager approval required if manager has turned on participant approval. 
    - Can upload a document. 


## {==Manage a Community==}

In public communities people can become members without manager approval and viewers (people who aren't members)can upload a document. {== You can choose to approve members and viewers as participants before they publish a document. for the first time==}. Once someone is approved as a participant {==you can still require manager approval of their future documents==}. If you are a manager of a private Community you can choose to turn on membership approval for your Community. This means creators or managers will have to approve membership requests before someone can join the Community.

### Manage the upload of documents for a Community
               
In public communities viewers (people who aren't members) can upload a document. If creators allows, people can become members without manager approval. As a manager you can still review and approve people before they can upload a document.
