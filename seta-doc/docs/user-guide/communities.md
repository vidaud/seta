## General
The communities of the SeTA web app is a shared space where members engage with each other to connect and learn about similar interests opinions of different type of publications. 

In the SeTA web app we have two types of communities: open communities and private communities.   

* **Open Community**:  Anyone with access to the web app can view all discussion forums and information in the online community. Anyone can join the community and contribute  to the community.   

* **Private Community**:  The information and conversations can only be accessed by users with log-ins(often sent via invitation to a specific group or pre-loaded into the community platforms membership database). All users are forced to ask for authorization to join and then been able to see content and conversations. In this type of communities the administrators have the ability to deny access to users who dont fit membership credentials (i.e. *members customers participants in a specific industry*)

### Difference between a member visitor and participant in open communities
                        
In open communities you can interact with a community as a member or as a visitor. Once a member or visitor posts or comments in the community they become a participant. 

-  **Member**:  someone who has joined the community. 
    - No admin approval required. 
    - Can post and comment. 
    
- **Visitor**: someone who isnt a member of the community. 
    - No admin approval required. 
    - Can post and comment. 
    
- **Participant**: a member or visitor who has posted or commented in the community. 
    - Admin approval required if admin has turned on participant approval. 
    - Can post and comment.


## Manage a community 

In open communities people can become members without admin approval and visitors (people who arent members)can post and comment. You can choose to approve members and visitors as participants before they publish a post or comment for the first time. Once someone is approved as a participant you can still require admin approval of their future posts. If youre an admin of a private community you can choose to turn on membership approval for your community. This means admins or moderators will have to approve membership requests before someone can join the community.

### Manage the post for a community
               
In open communities visitors (people who arent members) can post and comment if admins allow and people can become members without admin approval. You can still review and approve people before they can post or comment.
