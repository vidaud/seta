Within the search page the options to search are:

* By term
* By phrase
* By document or text
    

### Search by term
If we search by a term, when we start typing in the search bar, a dropdown box appears automatically, in this dropdown box we see two sections:

- a section with a list of *autocomplete* words (left side), 
- a section with a map of the *related terms* to search (right side). Also, in this section, there is the possibility to choose for *Related Terms Clusters* or *Related Terms*.

### Search by phrase
If we want to search by phrase it is necessary to enclose with double quotes *^^" "^^* the phrase, after that, as with the term search, the dropdown box will appear automatically with the two sections: *autocomplete* and *Related Terms Clusters* or *Related Terms*.

### Search by document or text

If you want to search by uploading a document or by a text, just click in the cloud button ![Image title](../img/cloud-button.png){ width=30} and a pop-up window will appear. In this window, there are two sections; the first one on top is to upload the document, we can either select the path where the document is located or we can drag and drop. Either uploading or by drag and drop it is always possible to cancel the upload of the file before the search, with the button ![Image title](../img/cancel-upload.png){ width=30}.


In the lower section of the pop-up it is possible to paste the text you want to search. 


If we don't want to search with this option, it is always possible to cancel the search with the *cancel* button at the bottom of the pop up, and the pop-up window will close.

On the left side of the search bar, there are three panels that helps manage the results: 

### Filters         
After launching a search, a new section with the results will appear below the search box (see image below). Together with the results there are some filters that can be applied to refine the search:

- Text chunk   
Chunking is a process of extracting phrases from unstructured text, in our case, it is possible to filter the results by: 
    1. First chunk of the text
    2. Single chunk only,  or
    3. Any chunks

- Filter by date range
If this option is switched on, then the time range bar below, can be adjust to the custom year range.        

- Data sources        
In this section it is possible to select from the different sources available a more specific source topic.

- Taxonomies                
From the different taxonomies proposed in this section, it can be possible to select only the results with a specific group of interest.


Once all the filters are selected, click in the button “Apply Filters” at the top of the section to apply them.
