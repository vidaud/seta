# Applications List
In SeTA, applications refer to integrations or external services that connect and interact with SeTA through APIs or for user authentication and authorization.

These integrations or applications extend SeTA's functionalities. SeTA provides a way to manage these applications within its settings, allowing users to configure, enable, or disable these connections based on their requirements.

Initially, you don't have any applications associated to your account. The list of applications in the dedicated page will be empty.
